GNSAdoDb [C++ ActiveX Data Object wrapper]
==========================================
Library that abstracts and simplify ADO programming in native C++,
making it as easy as ADO programming in Visual Basic 6. It only supports 
MS Access(2003 and below) and MS SQL Server(I have only tested 2005 edition) currently, of course it can be easily modified to support more database providers.

Requirement
===============================
STL, 
C++ runtime, 
MSADO type library (included).
